# User Permit Tool

This project provides a utility for creating and decrypting user permits using Blowfish encryption. The core functionality is implemented in the `user_permit.py` file located in the `tools` directory. The `user_permit_tool.py` script provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the user permit system.
